# Ethics, scalability and reach: a data scientistâ€™s guide to emerging tools in open source

This is a free-of-cost workshop series introducing Python packages with applicability in data science: Fairlearn, Ploomber and Dash, each specializing in ethics in artificial intelligence, scalable data pipelines, and dashboards, respectively. 

## About this workshop series

The series will be broken down into three workshops, each lasting 1.5 hours. The workshops are designed to get participants from setting up, to deploying applications with each of the libraries explored. Each workshop will dedicate the first 10-15 minutes to getting to know the participants and providing support setting up (initializing virtual environments, installing dependencies) and will be followed by discussion and hands on exercises. A more in depth breakdown is presented below. 

 ### Workshop I: ethics in artificial intelligence, an introduction to Fairlearn

1. Motivating the importance of ethics in AI
2. Introducing working example: use of AI to identify patients who require additional care
3. Discussion on possible pitfalls, the role of abstraction and traps data scientists can fall into
4. Introduction to the Fairlearn Python package
5. Applying Python packages Pandas and Scikit-learn on problem to train model on patient data
6. Evaluate model accuracy and biases using Fairlearn
7. Improving model bias through Fairlearn
8. Final remarks

### Workshop II: building production-ready pipelines with Ploomber

1. Motivating the need for scalable and maintainable pipelines
2. Refactoring a legacy notebook
3. The pipeline.yaml file.
4. Building the pipeline
5. Declaring dependencies
6. Adding a new task
7. Incremental builds
8. Execution in the cloud
9. Final remarks

### Workshop III: data storytelling and building dashboards with Dash 

1. Motivating data problem: increase in housing prices
2. Data exploration with Pandas
3. Data visualization with Plotly
4. Introduction to scripting in Python
5. The anatomy of a Dash App script
6. Designing and implementing dashboard layouts
7. Elements needed to deploy dashboard to online service
8. Deploying dashboard
9. Final remarks
